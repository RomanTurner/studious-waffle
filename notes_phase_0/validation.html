      <h1>HTML Validation</h1>
      <p>
        Like all other programming languages, HTML can contain all kinds of
        different errors. These can range from missing angle brackets to wrong
        or missing opening or closing tags, unnecessary or missing attributes,
        and many other issues. Our web browsers are pretty good at filling in
        the missing pieces but we can't always count on it being the same
        experience with every one. Tools like W3C's HTML Validator can catch
        these errors and prevent our user from having a poor experience.
      </p>
      <h2>Identifying HTML Errors</h2>
      <p>
        Now that we have a page full of HTML validation errors, how do we start
        fixing them? There are several parts of the error message that will help
        us parse the error, and figure out exactly where it is and what we can
        do to fix it.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/learn-verified/html-error-description.png"
        alt="Error Description example"
        width= 75%;
        height=75%;
      />
      <h3>Error Description</h3>
      <p>
        The first line of the error is our error description. This is a
        narrative that gives us a little bit more information about our error.
      </p>
      <h3>Error Location</h3>
      <p>
        The second and third lines of this error give us the exact location of
        the error, as well as a highlighted snippet of our HTML to help us
        exactly locate where the error is.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/learn-verified/html-error-location.png"
        alt="Error Location"
          width= 75%;
        height=75%;
      />
      <p>
        In this case, it's letting us know that our error is on line 10, from
        column 34-38. Line numbers will become very important in troubleshooting
        errors, in JavaScript and CSS as well as HTML. These error messages can
        serve as a road map to us, and help us troubleshoot much more
        efficiently.

      <h2>Navigating the MDN Reference Guide</h2>
      <p>

          >MDN HTML Reference Guide
        </a>
        (Links to an external site.) is a list of HTML tags grouped together by
        their functions. These sections are not entirely "human readable," which
        makes it a bit difficult to understand where to start looking. Some of
        the headings are very technical-sounding. To help you find what you need
        in this listing, we've created this helpful table to help you convert
        between MDN-ese and the HTML terms you have learned. We've also listed
        only the MDN content sections that you're most likely to use:
