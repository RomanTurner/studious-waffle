      <h1>Browser's Development Tools</h1>
      <p>
        The Developer tools that browsers provide you are a great way to
        experiment with HTML and CSS, and immediately see how those changes are
        rendered in the browser.
      </p>
      <h2>Use the Developer Tools to Edit HTML</h2>
      <p>
        There should be a drop down arrow next to the first
        <code> &lt;p&gt;</code>
        If you don't already see more elements nested under that
        <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, click on the arrow. When you click it, more text
        should show up, including the actual body of the tweet. Right click that
        text and select <code>Edit as HTML</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        A new window will pop up where we can actually go in and type. Try
        deleting the body of the tweet, and entering your own message. Once
        you're done, just click outside of the text window, and take a look back
        at the tweet in the browser. It should have changed to your message. If
        you refresh the page, your text will disappear. We're just editing HTML
        in our own web browser, not on Twitter's web server. Feel free to scroll
        around on Twitter and play with all sorts of different HTML elements and
        see what happens.

      <h2>Editing Images</h2>
      <p>
        See if you can find an image. It will be wrapped in HTML tags that start
        with <code>&lt;img src=...</code> You can right click on the image tag
        in the HTML and again select <code>Edit as HTML</code>. Between the quotes after <code>&lt;src=</code>
        you can replace the image with another one from a website.
