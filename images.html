    <h2>The Img Tag</h2>
    <p>
      Images are inserted into HTML using the img tag. The tag can display a
      variety of image types, including animated GIFs, bitmaps and vector
      graphics, though most often, the images we see on the internet are JPEG
      and PNG files. The img tag is self closing, meaning it doesn't wrap around
      content or text. Instead, the relevant information is stored in attributes
      within the tag itself. There are two main attributes, src, the source of
      the image, and alt, the alternate text.
    </p>
    <h2>The Image Source Attribute</h2>
    <p>
      The src attribute provides the relative path or URL to the image file we
      want to display. The image file can be local, say, for instance, if you're
      publishing a website and have a local stored in a folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, its very common, even when publishing your own websites, to have
      images hosted somewhere else on the internet. In these situations, we need
      to provide a full URL as the source. The src attribute always necessary,
      as without it, the img tag would have nothing to display.
    </p>
    <h2>The Image Alt Attribute</h2>
    <p>
      The alt attribute contains text relevant to the image we're displaying,
      and will appear in its place if the image fails to load. While it isn't
      required, it is highly recommended that every image includes an alt
      attribute. The alt text is important for screen readers for the visually
      impaired, as the text will be read out loud to the site visitor. It is
      also nice to provide some sort of message to a website visitor if the
      image fails to load, especially if the image is relevant to the rest of
      the content. Alt text on a failed image will appear along with a small
      'broken image' icon:
