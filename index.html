      <h2>Using an 'a' Tag to Create a Link</h2>

     This is the code that they use on their site to display the code block. It doesn't show up

      <h2>Identify Ordered, Unordered and Definition Lists</h2>
      <h3>Unordered list</h3>
      <p>
        When we want to present a list of items in a clear, readable format, we
        turn to the HTML unordered list, represented by the <code>ul</code> tag
        <br />
        Here is an example of the unordered list:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first Item in the list</li>
        <li>The second Item in the unordered list.</li>
        <li>The list is unordered because it is not numbered.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="Ordered-lists">Ordered lists</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>First Item in an ordererd list</li>
        <li>Second Item in an ordered list</li>
        <li>The Goldilocks of the ordered list</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Deifinition lists</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>First term</dt>
        <dd>Term Definition</dd>
        <dt>Second term</dt>
        <dd>Term Definition</dd>
        <dt>Third term</dt>
        <dd>Term Definition</dd>
        <dt>Fourth term</dt>
        <dd>Term Definition</dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>Identify Images</h2>
      <p>To include an image in our page, we use an <code>img</code> tag.</p>
      <img
        src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74572905?s=460&u=af19d3dff27fcd14a354c0594ac1172972032ef4&v=4"
        alt="GitHub Profile Picture of Roman Turner"
        title="Display Title"
      />

      <p>
        There are two notable things about the img tag: The first is that it
        does not have a closing tag. The image tag closes itself. Secondly, it
        handles a lot of attributes. Attributes are special keywords used on the
        tag to control the element's behavior, or provide additional information
        about the HTML element.
      </p>
      <p>
        The alt attribute provides descriptive text the browser can display if
        it can't find the image file. The browser can also display the title
        text to give the user more information about the image. The width and
        height attributes define the size of the image that shows up in the
        browser.
      </p>

    <h3>Identify Links</h3>
    <section>
      <p>
        You might be familiar with basic link structure already, but here are
        other ways we can use them. Beginning with a standard text hyperlink, we
        an wrap other elements inside of them. This is a link to my website:
        <a href="https://www.seattleiconic.com/" target="_blank"
          >SeattleIconic.com</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an example of using the same 'a' tag to create a link. This time
        we are using a picture as the link item. If you click on this image it
        will take you to my website.
      </p>
      <a href="https://www.seattleiconic.com/"
        ><img
          src="https://www.seattleiconic.com/wp-content/uploads/elementor/thumbs/Handingapple-1-oq3rrbnvh7n0b3yfcoxfmvftj2os2hica8dcoxbi60.jpg"
          alt="Green grocer handing fruit over the counter at a farmer's market."
      /></a>
      <p>We can also link other useful things like an email address:</p>
      <a href="mailto: rn.turner@live.com"
        >You can send me an email by clicking this sentance.</a
      >
      <p>
        Sometimes we might want to link to a specific location on the same
        webpage. We can then target an element that we identified or classified
        earlier.
      </p>
      <a href="#Ordered-lists"
        >Clicking here will take you back to the Ordered lists.</a
      >
      <p>
        When considering what location links point to, you will choose between
        relative or absolute links. A relative link directs to content within
        the same website:
      </p>
      <a href="page-two.html" target="_blank"
        >This will take you to the relative URL!</a
      >
      <p>
        On the other hand, the absolute link is what is used above that links to
        a different websit using their full URL.
