    <h1>The Table Tag</h1>
    <h3><a href="index.html">Home</a></h3>
    <p>
      It's important to note: order really matters when building a table in
      HTML! We're trying to display a two-dimensional table, but browsers
      interpret HTML line by line. For this reason, HTML tables were designed so
      that there is no tag for columns, only rows. If you were creating a table
      with 5 rows and 5 columns, in designing the table, we would actually have
      to create 5 rows, each with 5 individual cells inside. When displayed, the
      cells in each row will line up to look like columns. Table rows always
      come first. To make a row inside our table, we use the table row tag.
    </p>
    <h2>Table Header Tag</h2>
    <p>
      Tables generally start with a row of headers to label each column, so the
      first tr tag we write will be dedicated to these headers.
    </p>
    <h3>Inspect to see example:</h3>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Phone Number</th>
        <th>Bringing</th>
      </tr>
      <tr></tr>
      <tr></tr>
      <tr></tr>
    </table>
    <h2>The Table Data Tag</h2>
    <p>
      In the second row, we can start putting in our data. Here, we want to use
      the table data tag, (td) instead of using the table header tag. The (td)
      tag represents one table cell. So, for our party table, we can add in some
      names, phone numbers and items for guests to bring.
    </p>

    <tr>
      <td>Daniel</td>
      <td>845-282-4000</td>
      <td>Guacamole</td>
    </tr>
    <p>
      As long as each bit of data in a
      <td>is in the same position as the corresponding</td>
      <th>in the first row, it will show up in that column.</th>
    </p>
